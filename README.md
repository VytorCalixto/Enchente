This is the REPO referring to our Artifitial Intelligence project:

Given the Professor's base code, we will write our own Player code.
The Player will take in a Flood-It game board, and based on it, 
the Player will try to find (under 10 minutes) the best possible 
set of color choices to win the game and return it.
